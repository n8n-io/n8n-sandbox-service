# Docker/Sysbox Runner Runtime

This runtime starts each sandbox as a Docker container managed by the runner's
inner Docker daemon. In production it is expected to run in a Sysbox-backed
runner container so Docker-in-Docker can run without giving ordinary workload
containers direct access to the host Docker daemon.

## Technology

- Uses the Docker CLI against `SANDBOX_RUNNER_DOCKER_HOST`.
- Starts sandbox containers from `SANDBOX_RUNNER_DOCKER_SANDBOX_IMAGE`.
- Connects containers to the runner bridge network.
- Proxies API traffic to the sandbox daemon on port `8081`.

## Supported Features

- Pulls the sandbox image in the background and retries with backoff until it is
  available.
- Reports readiness only after the sandbox image is present and Docker is
  reachable.
- Reports capacity from the current managed container count.
- Applies default memory, CPU, PID, and optional disk quota limits on create.
- Applies Docker-specific network isolation rules through `netrules`.
- Waits for daemon `/healthz` and a tiny `/executions` round trip before
  returning a sandbox as ready.
- Wakes stopped containers on proxy access, reapplies network rules, and waits
  for the daemon before proxying.
- Uses singleflight so concurrent wake requests for the same sandbox only run
  one wake operation.
- Best-effort reconciles and removes stale managed containers on startup and
  shutdown.
